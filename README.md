## Project description


This code allows us to calculate the dimensions of an elevator (such as its tension, angular velocity, etc.) based on data requested by the code or through a .csv file. We can also simulate this elevator using the graphical interface.


# How to install

Install the files.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfdc696f-0fa1-4481-bd86-4cc8b1079fec)


Open VS Code and create a project.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2afb374b-37cc-4f05-a7e0-897e13e6604f)


Place the downloaded files in the project you created, as you need the external dependencies. Open the Solution Explorer and select the header/source files.


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0a801d5-9735-4bf0-abde-821f0d8867ed)

Attach the .h and .cpp files.

Install the SFML library and watch the video in the external dependencies to finalize the project setup. Once this step is complete, you can run the program.

If there is a compilation error, it is either due to the implementation of the SFML library or the location of the files.

## Examples of usage


### Example 1 : Calculate the Tension

Step 1:


Start the code and enter "1" to choose the calculation of the tension.

Select which tension you want to calculate. For example, we will select the first one (we will enter 0 for this example).

Enter which value of dimension you can enter (we will enter a 0 again).

Enter le values of the dimensions resquested

Then you should see the results of the calculation.


### Example 2 : Usage of the .csv file

Start the code and enter "8" to choose the use of a .csv file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a51d115-a511-4bd1-bf9d-2ba4d989c3c7)

Then, you can choose which dimension you want to calculate (for exemple 6).

To quit, enter 10.

To edit the values, go to your projet file --> dependances_exterieurs --> Fichier_Donnee.csv --> then edit your values

### Example 3 : Usage of the graphical interface.

Start the code and enter "9" to choose the graphical interface.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/268d9693-c500-435d-b62c-ae1fa5b2aa8d)

To show the commands, type "H".

### Example 4 : Usage of the log files.

Go to your project folder.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98dd77d5-d146-4681-97b5-92e31c3b10c8)

Go to the folder "SimulateurAscenseur".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f860abc-a5d7-488a-8b8b-a01ffd5238b1)

And then open "log.txt" to see your logs.
